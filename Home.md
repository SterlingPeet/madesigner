# Introduction #

MADesigner is a parametric modeling system which can be used to rapidly design traditional built up model aircraft (and probably some other things.) The advantage of a script based design system is that you can easily make small (or large) changes that cascade throughout the entire design by tweaking a value or two in your script and rerunning it.


# Airfoils #
  * AirfoilBlend: Airfoil blending, scaling, and rotation
  * AirfoilFit: Smoothing, resampling, and adaptive fitting of airfoil curves.
  * AirfoilCutouts: Cutting out basic shapes from airfoils for leading/trailing edges, spars, stringers, lightening holes, etc.

# Wings #

  * WingPlan: Automatically generate all your rib shapes for a laser cutter and create a life size wing plan that can be printed on a wide format plotter.
  * WingCurves: Unleash your creative side and design classic curved wings.
  * WingFlaps: Automatically engineer builtup control surfaces into your complex curved wings.
  * WingVisualize: Automatically generate a 3d model of your entire structure.  (Useful for a design review or day dreaming.)
