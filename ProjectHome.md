MADesigner is a parametric modeling system which can be used to rapidly design traditional built up model aircraft (and probably some other things.) The advantage of a script based design system is that you can easily make small (or large) changes that cascade throughout the entire design by tweaking a value or two in your script and rerunning it.

This project is a "work in progress" but you can look at the pictures and example code to get a better idea of my approach.  And you can download the code and run all the examples yourself if you like.
